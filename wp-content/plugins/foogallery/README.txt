Foo Gallery is the most intuitive and extensible gallery management tool ever created for WordPress.

== Description ==

Foo Gallery allows for better image and video gallery management within WordPress. Built to be simple for users and highly flexible for developers.

[View the Foo Gallery Homepage & DEMO](http://foo.gallery/)

**Retina Support**

Foo Gallery now comes with built-in support for higher quality thumbnails on retina-enabled displays. No more blurry thumbnails, just crisp thumbnails that look amazing on all devices.

**Video Support**

Foo Gallery now supports the creation of video galleries with the [FooVideo premium extension](http://fooplugins.com/plugins/foovideo/?utm_source=foogalleryplugin&utm_medium=foogallerylink&utm_campaign=foogallery_wprepo)! Create galleries with both images and videos mixed!

**Albums Built In**

Albums are now built in as an extension. Simply head over to the extensions page and activate the albums extension. A new menu item will appear that allows you to add albums just as easily as galleries.

**Built For Developers**

Foo Gallery was designed to be the most developer-friendly gallery plugin available for WordPress. It was also built on top of a solid extension framework, which means different functionality is separated out into different areas in the codebase. It also means the core plugin is lightweight, but still allowing for the most flexibility.

Have you enabled retina support for your galleries? Displays with retina support can show better quality thumbnails when retina support is enabled. To enable retina support, edit the gallery and locate the Retina Support metabox.

= Can I add videos to my galleries? =

Yes, you need to use the [FooVideo premium extension](http://fooplugins.com/plugins/foovideo/?utm_source=foogalleryplugin&utm_medium=foogallerylink&utm_campaign=foogallery_wprepo)

= How do I get albums working? =

Simply go to the FooGallery extensions page and activate the Albums extension. If you do not see a button to activate the albums extension, reload the extensions list by clicking the reload button.

= Can I build an extension? =

Hell, yes! Check out our [developer page](http://foo.gallery/developers/)
